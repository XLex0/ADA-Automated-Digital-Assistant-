# ADA-Automated-Digital-Assistant-
ADA is a personal project designed to configure a versatile voice assistant that streamlines various processes and functions to make tasks easier.

#### Note for queries
To enhance the effectiveness of Ada's transcription capabilities, it is important to begin your queries with a specific introductory phrase. I recommend starting with:

"Hola, ¿cómo estás? ¿Puedes...?"

Using this initial phrase not only improves transcription accuracy but is also crucial
for the system's functionality. The word "puedes," along with its different conjugations, 
serves as the activation word, similar to "Alexa" or "Hey Google."
